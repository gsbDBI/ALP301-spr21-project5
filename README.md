# Repository for ALP301 Spring 20/21 Project 5

Within this repository, you will find a folder titled Tutorials, which contains all the Rmd and html files from the tutorial files provided by the teaching team as well as `master` files which contain the core analysis we performed. The tutorial files received (in order) are titled: 

* `s2m_descriptive_analysis.Rmd` (and corresponding html): For complete data pre-processing and initial descriptive analysis 
* `final_tutorial_part1.Rmd` (and corresponding html): For preliminary cohort analysis
* `final_tutorial_pt2.Rmd` (and corresponding html): For detailed cohort analysis and user-segmentation via clustering, as well as basic predictive modeling

The tutorial files must be looked at as workspaces where we built upon the start provided by the teaching team and carried our analysis to completion, documenting and implementing each of the steps in the procedure. The final model decided on and implemented is present in the `master` files (for example `master_clustering.Rmd` and corresponding html). Therefore, the `master` files must be directly used for implementation, whereas the tutorial files and corresponding html files must only be referenced for more details and code for the entire process followed. While data frames and objects have been named carefully to avoid overwriting, we recommend running the code chunks sequentially from top to bottom.
